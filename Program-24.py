# Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area.

base = int(input("Enter The Base Of Triangle : " ))
height = int(input("Enter The height Of Triangle : " ))
Area = 1 / 2 * base * height
print("Area Of Given Triangle Is : ", Area)

'''
output = 
Enter The Base Of Triangle : 2
Enter The height Of Triangle : 4
Area Of Given Triangle Is :  4.0
